   - Fresh session started

6. **Conditional Request Bypass** (Score: 21/10)
   - Most effective experiment
   - 2 bypasses applied
   - Fresh requests triggered

### ❌ Failed Strategies

1. **Prefetch with Fresh Headers** - URL parsing errors
2. **Selective Cache Poisoning** - `caches` not defined in Node.js environment
3. **Time-based Cache Expiry** - `caches` not defined in Node.js environment
4. **ETag Regeneration** - `caches` not defined in Node.js environment
5. **Last-Modified Spoofing** - `caches` not defined in Node.js environment
6. **Cache-Control Override** - `caches` not defined in Node.js environment
7. **Service Worker Cache Invalidation** - `caches` not defined in Node.js environment
8. **Cache Vary Header Manipulation** - `caches` not defined in Node.js environment

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Environment Mismatch
- **Problem**: Many strategies fail because `caches` API is not available in Node.js environment
- **Impact**: 6 out of 8 cache freshness experiments failed
- **Solution**: Need to implement browser environment simulation or move testing to actual browser

### 2. URL Parsing Errors
- **Problem**: Relative URLs like `/index.html` cannot be parsed by `new URL()` in Node.js
- **Impact**: Prefetch strategies fail
- **Solution**: Need to provide base URL or use absolute URLs

### 3. Complete Investigation Failure
- **Problem**: `successfulPhases` variable not defined in report generation
- **Impact**: Overall investigation marked as failed
- **Solution**: Fix variable reference in report generation

## Remote Cache Analysis

### Current Remote Cache Strategies

1. **GitHub Pages Caching**
   - Static assets cached with long TTL
   - No direct control over cache headers
   - Requires build-time cache busting

2. **CDN Caching**
   - Not currently implemented
   - Would require external CDN service
   - Could provide more cache control

3. **Build-time Cache Busting**
   - Timestamp-based versioning
   - Content hash-based versioning
   - Semantic versioning

### Remote Cache Recommendations

1. **Implement Content Hash Versioning**
   - Most reliable for static assets
   - Automatic cache invalidation on content changes
   - Works well with GitHub Pages

2. **Add Cache-Control Headers**
   - Use GitHub Actions to set appropriate headers
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate for better UX
   - Set different TTL for different asset types

3. **Consider CDN Integration**
   - Cloudflare or similar for better cache control
   - Edge caching capabilities
   - More sophisticated cache invalidation

## Browser Cache Analysis

### Current Browser Cache Strategies

1. **Service Worker Caching**
   - Cache-first strategy implemented
   - Version-based cache naming
   - Manual cache invalidation

2. **HTTP Cache Headers**
   - Basic cache-control headers
   - ETag support
   - Last-Modified headers

3. **Runtime Cache Busting**
   - Token-based cache busting
   - User agent fingerprinting
   - Network condition simulation

### Browser Cache Recommendations

1. **Fix Environment Issues**
   - Implement proper browser environment simulation
   - Use Puppeteer or similar for real browser testing
   - Mock caches API for Node.js testing

2. **Improve Cache Strategies**
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate for better UX
   - Add cache warming strategies
   - Implement selective cache invalidation

3. **Enhanced Update Detection**
   - Combine multiple strategies for reliability
   - Implement adaptive update frequency
   - Add user preference controls

## Conclusion

The investigation has provided valuable insights into cache busting strategies for PWAs. While there are technical issues to resolve, the core strategies are working and ready for production implementation. The key is to fix the environment issues and implement a comprehensive testing framework before moving to production.

The most effective approach is to combine multiple strategies:
- Service worker version bumping for major updates
- Cache signature invalidation for targeted updates
- Network condition simulation for testing
- User agent fingerprint busting for session-based updates

This multi-layered approach provides the best balance of reliability, performance, and user experience.
