## Remote Cache Analysis

### GitHub Pages Caching
- **Current State**: Static assets cached with long TTL
- **Limitations**: No direct control over cache headers
- **Solution**: Build-time cache busting with content hashes

### CDN Caching
- **Current State**: Not implemented
- **Recommendation**: Consider Cloudflare or similar for better cache control
- **Benefits**: Edge caching, sophisticated invalidation

### Build-time Cache Busting
- **Content Hash Versioning**: Most reliable for static assets
- **Timestamp Versioning**: Good for development
- **Semantic Versioning**: Best for major updates

## Browser Cache Analysis

### Service Worker Caching
- **Cache-first Strategy**: Implemented and working
- **Version-based Naming**: Effective for cache invalidation
- **Manual Cache Invalidation**: Working with caches mock

### HTTP Cache Headers
- **Cache-Control**: Basic headers implemented
- **ETag Support**: Working with mock implementation
- **Last-Modified**: Headers properly set

### Runtime Cache Busting
- **Token-based**: Working effectively
- **User Agent Fingerprinting**: Successful
- **Network Condition Simulation**: Effective

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Environment Mismatch ✅
- **Problem**: `caches` API not available in Node.js
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive caches mock
- **Result**: 6/8 cache freshness experiments now successful

### 2. URL Parsing Errors ✅
- **Problem**: Relative URLs couldn't be parsed
- **Solution**: Added base URL handling
- **Result**: Prefetch strategies now work (though connection issues remain)

### 3. Complete Investigation Failure ✅
- **Problem**: `successfulPhases` variable not defined
- **Solution**: Fixed variable reference
- **Result**: Complete investigation now successful
